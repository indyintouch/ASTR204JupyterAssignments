There's a library called \"astropy\" that we can use to do this work for us. It turns out that in order to calculate lookback time you have to choose which version of the universe you believe.  For our purposes we will choose the parameters determined by Planck13.  Planck is a satellite that measured the temperature and polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background. \n",

(There's actually a controversy over whether it's 68 or 72 km/sec per Mpc. From looking at supernovae (as we did here) researchers get 72 km/sec per Mpc.  From looking at the anisotropy in the microwave background researchers get 68 km/sec per Mpc.)  The reason we didn't get 70 km/sec is that Riess and colleagues don't care about the intrinsic brightness of the supernovae they are using as standard candles. In other words, even though they are using a standard candle to do all this analysis, the actual brightness of the standard candle doesn't enter into their calculations.

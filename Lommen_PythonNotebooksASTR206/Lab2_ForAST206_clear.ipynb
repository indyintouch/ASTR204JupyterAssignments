    "_A continuation of python exercise notebook written by Rita Tojeiro, October 2017, for the Lab component of the AS1001 Cosmology module at the University of St Andrews, UK.  It was modified to stand alone in an SDSS EPO workshop at AAS in Jan 2018 and then significantly modified to emphasize programming skills rather than Astronomy data analysis by Andrea Lommen, Haverford College, January 2018. \n",

    "In this Notebook, you will use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), to explore the relationship between galaxy properties and the large-scale structure of the Universe. \n",

    "In the end, you should have found an answer to the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How are galaxies spatially distributed in the Universe?\n",
    "- Are galaxies all the same colour?\n",
    "- Are galaxies all the same shape?\n",
    "- How are galaxies' colours and shapes related to their spacial distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab you mastered:\n",
    "- if statements, Boolean operators, arithmetic operations, and mean/min as necessary.\n",
    "- the use of np.where.\n",
    "- Writing variables into strings.\n",
    "And you also used a SQL query to read in data. ('SQL' is pronounced just like \"sequel\" by the way.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will master:\n",
    "\n",
    "- visualizing data by making plots and taking various \"slices\"\n",
    "- combined data structures (lists of lists), in this case it's the use of data frames in a library called \"pandas\". You actually used it last lab but didn't take advantage of it. I think of it like a table of data with rows and columns rather than a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",

    "Finally, we will explore the **relationship between morphology and environment**. It is extraordinarily difficult to write a computer programme that determines whether a galaxy has spiral structure or is smooth. To this day, the human eye does better than the most sophisticated algorithms (the reason behind projects such as Galaxy Zoo - https://www.galaxyzoo.org). We will use a very simple proxy for morphology, which is good enough for our purposes: the sersic index. The sersic index tells us how rapidly the light profile of a galaxy is falling from the center, and essentially classifies galaxies' light profiles as being very centrally concentrated (like ellipticals), or as being flatter (like spirals). \n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below repeats our initial SQL query, but now it also returns the sersic profile, called sersic_n, and we are already limiting the redshift range to be between 0.02 and 0.03."

In other words, make a set of 16 plots of high sersic index galaxies, and then a set of 16 plots of low sersic index galaxies. Let us test that idea that galaxies with a very high sersic index (n > 4) are ellipticals , and those with a very low sersic index (n < 2) are spirals. After you've looked at both those sets of plots (you should show them all below) answer this question: In your opinion, how good is this number at identifying morphology?"
